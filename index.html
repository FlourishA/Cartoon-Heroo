		<h2>About Mega Mind</h2>
		<p>Mega Minds is a super-intelligent alien supervillain, who after a long-lasting battle one day actually destroys his foe, the much-loved superhero Metro Man. Megamind later finds out that his villainy has no purpose and thus creates a new superhero to serve as his nemesis. His plan backfires, as he ends up creating instead a new supervillain. With Metro City spiraling out of control, Megamind attempts to set things right and discovers his newfound purposeâ€”as a superhero.</p>
